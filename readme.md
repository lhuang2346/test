# How To Update the Project with Git

1. Open Terminal
2. Change your active directory to this folder by typing `cd` and then dragging your local repo folder (the folder containing this readme) into the Terminal window.
3. Stage all changes with `git add .`
4. Make a commit: `git commit -m “your message”`
5. Push your changes: `git push`

Note: It is a good idea to run `git pull` before beginning work (between step 2 and 3), to make sure repo is up-to-date.
